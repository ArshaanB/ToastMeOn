			<h3>What are we?</h3>
			<p>ToastMeOn is an SMS-activated toaster with natural input commands, using Twillio/Spark Core and a PHP server backbone to link the two platforms.</p>
			<h3>How does it work?</h3>
			<p>An SMS from your phone to our Twilio Number can be used to control 120V home appliances, in this case, a toaster.</p>
			<h3>ToastMeOn Commands</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>On 2</li>
				<li>On 2 hours 3 min 6 sec</li>
				<li>On 2 at 13:45</li>
				<li>On 2 for 14:00</li>
				<li>kill</li>
				<li>status</li>
				<li>sudo UofTHacks on 2 ...</li>
				<li>rave</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Why Twilio/SMS?</h3>
			<p>SMS gives benefit of not needing a data plan, being applicable in areas without data coverage, or for people without data plans.</p>
			<h3>So you need wifi all the time at home (what about remote areas w/o wifi)?</h3>
			<p>The next step would be to find an SMS module for a central controller at home OR, rely on another smart device already at home and use wifi direct.</p>
			<h3>Isn’t this dangerous?</h3>
			<p>Authorized users have to either be whitelisted by caller id, or know the guest password to gain access to the controls. This acts as a safeguard against people trying to burn your house down. 
			Descriptive and powerful language ensures that accidental texts don’t lead to unintended behaviour. In the case that mistakes are made, ToastMeOn has a low latency emergency kill function.</p>
			<h3>Any other value to this project?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Versatility! Our hack makes an extension cord into an intelligent IoT enabled circuit relay - just connect to any 120V device!</li>
				<li>Energy consumption! Schedule device usage at off-peak hours for reduced energy cost.</li>
				<li>Saving time at home! Rather than come home and wait 2 hours for your rice cooker or slow cooker, send a text to have the food ready for 18:00.</li>
				<li>Accessibility (i.e. children, people with deteriorating health). Caregivers for people who can no longer live independently may be able to cook food remotely for their dependents when they can not be around in person. Parents may want to be able to heat up meals for their children arriving home before them.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Where will ToastMeOn go from here?</h3>
			<p>ToastMeOn is based on two key technologies - a powerful natural input over SMS, and an intelligent IoT enabled relay switch for 120V appliances.</p>

			<p>We have many features planned to improve on our inputs.  Support for multiple types of devices can be implemented by using distinct keywords (i.e. toast for toasters, wash for washing machines, cook for cookers). Linking actions, can be achieved for high power draw devices on the same connection, (i.e. microwave 2 min 30 sec then bake 30 min). More contextual support for devices can be introduced, such as (toast 2 min temp 350).</p>

			<p>The current IoT enabled relay switch is currently a breadboard prototype connected to an extension cord. The prototype can be better housed within a box for safety, stability, and portability.</p>
